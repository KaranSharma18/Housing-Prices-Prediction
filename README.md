# Housing Prices Prediction

![](https://github.com/KaranSharma18/Housing-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/California%20image.png)
<ul>
  <li>The aim of this project is to build a Machine Learning model which will predict Median Value of housing prices of California using the california census data. the data has a metrics such as population, median income, median housing prices and so on. The model able to predict the prices with RMSE - 47K. this Project Also Consist of Various Machine Learning Pipelines and Algorithms include Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines Regressor, Random Forest, etc </li></ul>
  
 
**Steps:**
<ul>
  <li>Data Wrangling</li>
  <li>Feature Engineering</li>
  <li>Data Visualization</li>
  <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machines</li> 
  <li>Fine-tune your Model</li></ul>
